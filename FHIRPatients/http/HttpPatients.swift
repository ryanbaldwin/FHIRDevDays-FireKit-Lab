// FHIRDevDays Lab TODO:
//
// Throughout the lab you will eventually create 3 requests here:
//  - 1 for POSTing a Patient
//  - 1 for PUTing a Patient
//  - 1 for Downloading a specific patient (based on the patient's `id`)
//
//  The `FindPatientsRequest` above is used in the Search feature of the app, and searches for patients
//  on the server based on their family name. It has been left here for your reference.
//
//  Hints:
//      - The `HttpDefaults.swift` file has sensible defaults on how we want to communciate with the server.
//        Specifically, it has defaults for the `baseURL` (https://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu2) of all Restables, as
//        well it is using the `Authenticating` protocol to set the `Prefer` header to be `return=representation`
//      - Each request should expect a `Patient` type as the response from the server.
//      - You can get a specific resource from a FHIR server by using the path `/[Resource Type]/[id]`.
//        For example, you can see my patient record at https://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu2/Patient/83403
